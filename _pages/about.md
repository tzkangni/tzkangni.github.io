I work at the School of Computer Science  as an assistant professor and [master‚Äôs supervisor](https://yjs.njupt.edu.cn/dsgl/nocontrol/college/dsfcxq.htm?dsJbxxId=32C25D4D68CE834EB4FF94079834CE0E) now, doing some fundamental research on  machine learning, computer vision, SAR image processing, and remote sensing image processing. I am also recruiting graduate students, if interested, feel free to email me at [tznikang@njupt.edu.cn](mailto:tznikang@njupt.edu.cn).

I graduated from the School of Electronic information engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (Âçó‰∫¨Ëà™Á©∫Ëà™Â§©Â§ßÂ≠¶ÁîµÂ≠ê‰ø°ÊÅØÂ∑•Á®ãÂ≠¶Èô¢) with a Ph.D‚Äôs degree in 2020, advised by prof. [Yiquan Wu (Âê¥‰∏ÄÂÖ®),](http://faculty.nuaa.edu.cn/wyq2/zh_CN/index.htm) and from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications with a post doctor in 2021, supervised by prof. [Yun Li(Êùé‰∫ë)](https://lidata-ai.github.io) .

My research interest includes machine learning, computer vision, SAR image processing, and optical remote sensing image processing. I have published more than 20 papers  at the signal processing conferences/journals such as IEEE JSTARSÔºåIEEE GRSLÔºåIGRASS.
